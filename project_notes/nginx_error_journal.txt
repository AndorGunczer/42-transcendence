NGINX ERROR JOURNAL:
    Nginx startup(brew services start/reload nginx)
    Nginx status check (brew services info nginx)
        probably error with configuration file

        log : /System/Volumes/Data/opt/homebrew/var/log/nginx || /opt/homebrew/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
        conf: /System/Volumes/Data/opt/homebrew/etc/nginx/nginx.conf || /opt/homebrew/var/log/nginx

        Error1: server cannot come before http
        Solution: Revert to default conf file, apply custom server expressions

        Error2: password protected private.key file
        Solution: recreate crt with a not password protected .key file
            # Generate an unencrypted private key
            openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private.key

            # Generate a CSR
            openssl req -new -key private.key -out request.csr

            # Generate a self-signed certificate
            openssl x509 -req -in request.csr -signkey private.key -out selfsigned.crt -days 365

    Error: Images are not forwarded
    Description: 404 - ERROR_NET_TIMED_OUT
    Root Cause Analysis:    - filepath on server in db is static with :8000 as port, requests are made to IP_ADDRESS:8000, while server listens at IP_ADDRESS:443
                            - ADDRESS_IP:PORT are saved static into the database
    Probable Quick Fix:     - Remove :8000 from static paths
                            - Re create database entries with correct addresses
    Solution: Make paths dynamic
