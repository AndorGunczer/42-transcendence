No Path /wss/communication (socket failure):
    Descripton: socket related urls are declared in routing.py, normal http related urls are at urls.py
        upon requests to socket urls, I get the 404 not found error, because only urls.py is checked.

    Fix: Replace fetch() with socket.send() in socket related functions
