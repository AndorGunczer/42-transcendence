CSRF requests fail upon introducing code to production infrastructure:
    settings.py ADD: CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = ["https://127.0.0.1", "https://localhost"]

No Path /wss/communication (socket failure):
    Descripton: socket related urls are declared in routing.py, normal http related urls are at urls.py
        upon requests to socket urls, I get the 404 not found error, because only urls.py is checked.
